Image Classification is one of the most interesting and useful applications of Deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks that enables us to automate the task of assembling similar images and arranging data without the supervision of real humans.

To build a classifier using a simple Convolution Neural Network which can classify the images of dogs and cats. 

* **Pandas** ‚Äì This library is used to load 2D array format and DataFrames.
  
* **Numpy** ‚Äì It is used to perform large computations in a very short time.
  
* **Matplotlib** ‚Äì This library is used to draw visualizations.
  
* **Sklearn** ‚Äì This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
  
* **OpenCV** ‚Äì This is an open-source library mainly focused on image processing and handling.
  
* **Tensorflow** ‚Äì This is an open-source library that is used for Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence and provides a range of functions to achieve complex functionalities with single lines of code.

## Importing Dataset 
The dataset is in the format of a zip file containing 2 folders : Cats and Dogs. Further each folder contains 12500 images of respective animals.

## Data Visualization
To understand visualize some images which have been provided to us to build the classifier for each class.
